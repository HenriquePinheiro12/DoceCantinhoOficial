# Final comments 🎂

The work was essential to practice all the learning that have been developed through my first year of frontend studying. With it, I could practice a lot of CSS, including technologies such as flexbox, animations, media queries and pseudo-classes.
I´ve shurely enjoyed all the learning I had and hope to have put it inside this project. 
Intending to start studying JS and Flexbox Grid from now
